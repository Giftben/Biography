            "This page was built to remember the great Zik of Africa, who left us on May 11, 1996. He is gone, but he is not forgotten. His dreams, ideas, and beliefs still live on in many Nigerians including myself. We will dearly miss him. He was my best friend, my mentor, my role model, my motivator, and most importantly, my father. As long as I live, I would make sure that the people who he fought for their freedom remember him. I shall also make sure that the poor and powerless Nigerians have a voice."
